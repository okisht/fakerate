# fakerate

This repo has some development for my nodejs base backend project (pricetracker)

in fakerate, i'll try to get some imgur urls (fake products) from users and store them in mongo db.
The main point is there will be an upvote and downvote selections for every url.
Users gonna choose their selection by similarity of original product.

images will be shown from imgur directly, and url string after "/" will be their uniq id.
